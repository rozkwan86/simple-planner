# simple-planner
A simple planner page generator written in Python.

Simple Planner is my first Python project not based on an exercise or challenge. Although I'm a fan of the Franklin-Covey planner system, I did not like how their planner pages had their appointment schedules marked at a set time range and interval. Simple Planner solves this issue by letting the user select a specific date they want for their page and whatever time intervals they think will work better for their appointments. It's a pretty rudimentary program and spits out a calendar, week number, your appointment scheduler, top ten to-dos, and a notes section all in one ".txt" file.  I'm still figuring out whether I'll be adding more features at this point.

You can use Simple Planner by running "python planner.py" on whatever command-line you use. This allows you to select an option as to whether you want to print a full year's calendar or get into the main program which generates the pages. Of course, if you wish to generate pages only, you can just run "pages.py". Be aware that I haven't implemented the program to repeat the process for different days, weeks, etc...
